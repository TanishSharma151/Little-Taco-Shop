This is a complex html and css website with a pinch of js.

This includes four different html files with a single css file that is used to style them, along with the usage of naming convention methodology that comprises of the famous BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)
which is a preset for many bug websites these days.

Along with that, css properties such as animations, positioning attributes, display layouts, row and column layout along with css functions and variables are greatly used by me in this website.

The light and dark modes as well as the media dependency on smaller pixels devices such as smartphones have some different features and the big pixalated screens such as tablets, laptops and pcs have different set of features....

It was a fun project to pull, man more to come in near future...
